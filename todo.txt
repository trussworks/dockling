* Make a server that spits out stats about the machine/locaiton it is running on
	x hostname
	x username
	x pwd
	* ls /
	* architecture
	* hostos
	x env vars
* have the server serve an endpoint that returns some simple HTML
	* have the PORT be configurable
* Exercise 1 is write a dockerfile to run the server
* spin up a postgres backend for another endpoint
* install some kind of depenedency to show layering. 

Concepts:

Dockerfile 
layers
cmd vs. entrypoint
multi-stage build
docker volumes
the workspace, you can't refer to things not copied in
image vs. container

Commands:

docker build
docker run 
docker pull
docker push
