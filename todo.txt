* Make a server that spits out stats about the machine/locaiton it is running on
	x hostname
	x username
	x pwd
	* ls /
	* architecture
	* hostos
	x env vars
x have the server serve an endpoint that returns some simple HTML
	x have the PORT be configurable
x Exercise 1 is write a dockerfile to run the server
* spin up a redis backend for another endpoint
	* redis requires less configuration, no schema, etc. 
	* though schema is instructive. let's try AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBlE
	x make an endpoint that adds something to redis. 
	x display the list
	* get to it from a container
* install some kind of depenedency to show layering. 

Concepts:

Dockerfile 
layers
cmd vs. entrypoint
multi-stage build
docker volumes
the workspace, you can't refer to things not copied in
image vs. container
copy . is a bad pattern, figure out image layer caching.
the whole context being mapped in
	- docker ignore is good for that
Networking
docker compose

Commands:

docker build
docker run 
docker pull
docker push



when it comes to development, how do you want to manage dependencies.
